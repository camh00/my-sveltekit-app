## Overview

`my-sveltekit-app` is a web project developed to practice and expand knowledge in JavaScript, with a particular focus on the SvelteKit framework. This app serves as a playground for exploring modern web development techniques, UI components, and the SvelteKit ecosystem.

The website makes use of the [Skeleton UI Toolkit](https://skeleton.dev), a minimalistic and easy-to-use CSS framework designed for fast, lightweight web design. By integrating Skeleton, the app aims to provide a clean and responsive design with minimal effort.
